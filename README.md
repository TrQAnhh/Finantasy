# Finantasy
Finantasy Game is a strategy game developed by us as a project for the Object-Oriented Programming course at International University - VNU HCMC. Set in a fantastical world inspired by classic games, our game challenges players to use their decision-making skills to navigate through a series of battles and quests.

In the game, players take on the role of heroes equipped with unique abilities and attributes, embarking on a journey to defeat formidable monsters and enemies. The game incorporates a turn-based system where each player has a designated period to perform actions such as attacking, defending, or using special items. After a player’s turn is completed, the monsters take their turn, and this cycle continues until the game's objective is met or the game concludes according to its rules.

The gameplay of our turn-based game requires strategic thinking and situational awareness. Players must make decisions based on the current state of the game, including resource management and tactical maneuvers. The game features various levels, each with unique challenges and objectives that players must complete to progress. Inspired by the renowned Final Fantasy I by Square Enix (1987), our game aims to provide a modern twist on classic turn-based gameplay.

Overall, our Finantasy Game is an engaging and challenging strategy game that showcases the skills and creativity of the developers at International University - VNU HCMC. With its strategic gameplay and impressive graphics, the game promises to provide hours of entertainment and a rewarding experience for players.
